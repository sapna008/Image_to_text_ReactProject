# Handwriting Recognition Web App

A React-based web application that converts handwritten text from images to digital text with 90% accuracy using Tesseract.js and OpenCV.

## 🌟 Live Demo

[Try the application](https://fascinating-macaron-e02d98.netlify.app/)

## ✨ Features

- Image to text conversion for handwritten content
- High accuracy rate (90%)
- Real-time processing
- User-friendly interface
- Support for various image formats
- Pre-processing capabilities using OpenCV

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tesseract.js - For Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- OpenCV - For image preprocessing
- Netlify - For deployment

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [your-repository-link]
cd [project-directory]
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Upload an image containing handwritten text
3. Wait for the processing to complete
4. View the converted digital text

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: The application accepts image input from users
2. **Preprocessing**: OpenCV enhances the image quality by:
   - Converting to grayscale
   - Applying noise reduction
   - Optimizing contrast
3. **Text Recognition**: Tesseract.js processes the enhanced image and extracts text
4. **Result Display**: The converted text is displayed to the user
